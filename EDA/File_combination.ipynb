         "Spin is a technical term specifically referring to intrinsic angular momentum of particles. It means a very specific thing in quantum/particle physics. (Physicists often borrow loosely related everyday words and give them a very precise physical/mathematical definition.)\nSince truly fundamental particles (e.g. electrons) are point entities, i.e. have no true size in space, it does not make sense to consider them 'spinning' in the common sense, yet they still possess their own angular momenta. Note however, that like many quantum states (fundamental variables of systems in quantum mechanics,) spin is quantised; i.e. it can only take one of a set of discrete values. Specifically, the allowed values of the spin quantum number $s$ are non-negative multiples of 1/2. The actual spin momentum (denoted $S$) is a multiple of Planck's constant, and is given by $S = \\hbar \\sqrt{s (s + 1)}$.\nWhen it comes to composite particles (e.g. nuclei, atoms), spin is actually fairly easy to deal with. Like normal (orbital) angular momentum, it adds up linearly. Hence a proton, made of three constituent quarks, has overall spin 1/2.\nIf you're curious as to how this (initially rather strange) concept of spin was discovered, I suggest reading about the Stern-Gerlach experiment of the 1920s.

         "Spin is a technical term specifically referring to intrinsic angular momentum of particles. It means a very specific thing in quantum/particle physics. (Physicists often borrow loosely related everyday words and give them a very precise physical/mathematical definition.)\nSince truly fundamental particles (e.g. electrons) are point entities, i.e. have no true size in space, it does not make sense to consider them 'spinning' in the common sense, yet they still possess their own angular momenta. Note however, that like many quantum states (fundamental variables of systems in quantum mechanics,) spin is quantised; i.e. it can only take one of a set of discrete values. Specifically, the allowed values of the spin quantum number  are non-negative multiples of 1/2. The actual spin momentum (denoted ) is a multiple of Planck's constant, and is given by .\nWhen it comes to composite particles (e.g. nuclei, atoms), spin is actually fairly easy to deal with. Like normal (orbital) angular momentum, it adds up linearly. Hence a proton, made of three constituent quarks, has overall spin 1/2.\nIf you're curious as to how this (initially rather strange) concept of spin was discovered, I suggest reading about the Stern-Gerlach experiment of the 1920s. It was later put into the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics by Schrodinger and Pauli.\n",

         "I saw a comment (seems to have vanished) to one of the answers that the view, heavily thrashed out in Smolin's book, that ST assumes a flat background whereas GR clearly accounts for dynamically bending spacetime is a bit moot insofar that GR could be construed of as being in a flat background with some fancy additions. Did this comment have any merit - could Lee Smolin truly have been unaware of such an interpretation? Or could it be something kind of trivial like the curved manifold of a GR solution can be embedded in a higher dimensional flat space (Whitney embedding). Comments anyone?",

         "@SeleneRoutley The question is not if the theory can be written as if there is a flat background, but rather if the flat background has physical consequences. Deser showed in the 70s that if you assume flat background and adding a spin 2 field, then require that the interacting theory is consistent, you get GR. But once you get GR, the flat background becomes undetectable. In fact Deser showed that whatever background you start with, it becomes unobservable. It’s like doing Newtonian physics in one specific frame: you can do it but it does not mean imply that there is a notion of absolute rest",

         "Spin is a technical term specifically referring to intrinsic angular momentum of particles. It means a very specific thing in quantum/particle physics. (Physicists often borrow loosely related everyday words and give them a very precise physical/mathematical definition.)\nSince truly fundamental particles (e.g. electrons) are point entities, i.e. have no true size in space, it does not make sense to consider them 'spinning' in the common sense, yet they still possess their own angular momenta. Note however, that like many quantum states (fundamental variables of systems in quantum mechanics,) spin is quantised; i.e. it can only take one of a set of discrete values. Specifically, the allowed values of the spin quantum number $s$ are non-negative multiples of 1/2. The actual spin momentum (denoted $S$) is a multiple of Planck's constant, and is given by $S = \\hbar \\sqrt{s (s + 1)}$.\nWhen it comes to composite particles (e.g. nuclei, atoms), spin is actually fairly easy to deal with. Like normal (orbital) angular momentum, it adds up linearly. Hence a proton, made of three constituent quarks, has overall spin 1/2.\nIf you're curious as to how this (initially rather strange) concept of spin was discovered, I suggest reading about the Stern-Gerlach experiment of the 1920s. It was later put into the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics by Schrodinger and Pauli.\n",

         "In general usage, \"sound\" refers to our perception of the vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in some medium, typically air or water, though sound waves can travel through any medium.  \nVibrations are produced whenever objects cause the particles in the medium to oscillate, e.g. clapping your hands together, beating a drum, or yelling.  \nSound can be measured the way it is heard - just as air molecules begin to vibrate in the presence of a vibrating object - the air molecules can cause other things to vibrate (such as our eardrums, or a part of a microphone) and we can quantify the level of sound by measuring the motion of the detector in any number of ways.\nAt a deeper level, sound waves are the \"Goldstone modes\" corresponding to broken translational symmetry of the surrounding medium.  \nLet me try to bring this a little more down to earth.  Think about a parcel of air, large enough to contain a lot of air molecules, but not so large that there are sizable air currents swirling within.  We can think of this in an ideal situation as being a fluid of uniform density.  This fluid has translational symmetry - if I translate it a little in any direction, it looks more or less the same \"in the bulk\".  Translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry, so I can squeeze the air in a spatially-varying way.  It turns out that if I do this in a wavelike pattern with a long wavelength, this is an excitation that costs very little energy, and hence will be important to the physics.  These waves are precisely sound waves.  This probably doesn't make much sense as I've written it, so I may try to edit this a bit later on if anyone is actually interested in this point of view.\n",

         "In general usage, \"sound\" refers to our perception of the vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in some medium, typically air or water, though sound waves can travel through any medium.  \nVibrations are produced whenever objects cause the particles in the medium to oscillate, e.g. clapping your hands together, beating a drum, or yelling.  \nSound can be measured the way it is heard - just as air molecules begin to vibrate in the presence of a vibrating object - the air molecules can cause other things to vibrate (such as our eardrums, or a part of a microphone) and we can quantify the level of sound by measuring the motion of the detector in any number of ways.\nAt a deeper level, sound waves are the \"Goldstone modes\" corresponding to broken translational symmetry of the surrounding medium.  \nLet me try to bring this a little more down to earth.  Think about a parcel of air, large enough to contain a lot of air molecules, but not so large that there are sizable air currents swirling within.  We can think of this in an ideal situation as being a fluid of uniform density.

         "Laplace's determinism is not physically correct over long periods of time.   That is, it neglects chaos/\"sensitive dependence on initial conditions\"/exponential growth of microscopic perturbations already in Newtonian dynamics, which was seriously thought about only in the 20th century.   Being true, this also will not be overcome.   Stochasticity enters some classical dynamical paths with time.\nThere is subtlety here.    In classical mechanics, or the evolution of the wave function, there is a kind of microdeterminism, so that what occurs in the next instant is fully determined by what occurred up until that point.

         "Laplace's determinism is not physically correct over long periods of time.   That is, it neglects chaos/\"sensitive dependence on initial conditions\"/exponential growth of microscopic perturbations already in Newtonian dynamics, which was seriously thought about only in the 20th century.   Being true, this also will not be overcome.   Stochasticity enters some classical dynamical paths with time.\nThere is subtlety here.    In classical mechanics, or the evolution of the wave function, there is a kind of microdeterminism, so that what occurs in the next instant is fully determined by what occurred up until that point.    It is in the longer time evolution of a chaotic system that stochasticity creeps in.\nBy the way, Lapalace said\n\"We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow.\"   This part remains true in chaotic classical mechanics.  \nHowever, he then continued \"An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes.

         "Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity cannot be of much significance to a lay person because he has no use for such knowledge. However, the common idea that this topic is extremely complicated motivates the layman to learn it.\nThe basic concepts of this theory are actually somewhat simple. In short, when an object is moving a certain velocity $u$, a few seemingly unusual phenomena happen to it. If a bar of length $L_0$ moves in the direction of its length, its new length will appear to be $L_0 \\sqrt{1 - u^2 / c^2}$ from the our viewpoint on the ground, where $c$ is the speed of light. If that formula means nothing to you, simply take note that the length decreases as the velocity increases. Of course, from the bar's viewpoint, it will appear that our length has changed by that factor.\nSince time is proportional to distance traveled at a constant velocity, the length contraction can show that the \"rate of time\" also changes when an object is moving. If a clock is traveling through space close to the speed of light, it will tick significantly slower than it did at rest.\nThose are the basics, but phenomena such as mass-energy equivalence and nuclear binding energy can be derived from these concepts and experiments conducted in the early 20th century.\n",

         "As others have pointed out, the question is somewhat misworded.\nThe correct question is probably just \"Why do magnets repel?\", which can be traced back to the question of why electromagnetism (EM) is a fundamental force of nature. Like gravity, it's one of the four known fundamental forces of nature.\nRegarding the use of the word \"energy\". Energy is the same thing as work. Work = Force x distance. If there is a 10N [Newton] force acting on a ball, and you move the ball by 1m [meter], you have done 10N x 1M = 10Nn = 10J [Joule] of work (provided the force is constant). So, if you move the magnetic poles against each other, you do work (against the EM field). Then, if you attach the magnets to a spring and let go, the springs will compress. The 10J of work you invested is now stored in the springs! Then, if you remove the magnets and put a bullet on the spring, and let go, you can use the 10J of energy to launch the bullet (work is converted to kinetic energy), and so on =)\nWhat happens when you push two magnets against each other, but then just hold them in place? Per the above definition of Work = Force x distance, you're not doing work, because distance = 0. But clearly your muscles are straining, and you're burning calories (which is just another unit of energy or work, like Joules), so what's going on? From a physics textbook point of view, no work is being done. This is similar to placing an apple on a table. The table is countering the force of gravity, like your muscles in the magnet example. The table has no muscles, because it is made of wood, and it won't collapse under the weight of the apple. In reality, the stiffness of the table/wood is provided by the electromagentic interactions of the atoms making up the table, so in the end it is the EM force counteracting the gravitational force. In the original magnet/muscle example, your arms are not made up of wood, so your body is doing biochemical/mechanical work to stiffen the cells in your arms by burning the food you ate. (The fact that this process is not perfect means that heat is a by product of this process, that's why your muscles get hot and you start sweating.)\n",
