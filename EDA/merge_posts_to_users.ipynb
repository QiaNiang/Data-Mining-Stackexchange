You could then have an automaton traverse the graph to find \"cycles\" (which indicate a set of \"logically equivalent\" assertions), \"sources\" (which indicate powerful statements), and \"sinks\" (which indicate weak ones).\nBut the usefulness of such a graph (even if received in Complete Perfection by a Supreme Intelligence) is limited by our ability to find the node for a given logical assertion. Making the statements as abstract as possible reduces the number of nodes in the graph (which may help) but may make it harder to decide if a given node (e.g. a theorem in Category Theory) really is equivalent to (or stronger than) the particular assertion we're interested in (e.g. a theorem in algebraic topology).\nBut maybe we're in a better position today to make the \"search\" for relevant nodes easier (e.g. by decorating the abstract statement of a theorem with \"links\" to equivalent forms and specific applications) than were previous generations of logicians. And if you actually start to build the graph maybe you'll figure out a format for \"nodes\" and \"edges\" that is sufficiently general to make the project appealing to other people, and you can make some progress.\nGood luck!\nEDIT: The distinction between \"nodes\" and \"edges\" is of course artificial - after all, logical statements boil down to implication, e.g. \"A and B together imply C\", and \"logical statement X is stronger than logical statement Y\" is itself a logical statement.

Now, consider the norm $N(a_1v_1 +\\cdots+a_nv_n)=\\max(|a_1|,\\ldots,|a_n|)$. Then, there is an $r>0$, such that $||x-p||<r$ and $x$ is in $V$ $\\implies$ $x$ is in $S$, since on a finite dim. space, all norms are equivalent. Let $m<k\\leq n$,and chose $v$ in $V$ as:\n$$v=\\left(b_1+\\frac{r}{2}\\right)v_1+\\left(b_2+\\frac{r}{2}\\right)v_2+\\cdots+\\left(b_m+\\frac{r}{m}\\right)v_m+\\frac{r}{2}v_k$$\n Then, $N(v-p)\\leq\\frac{r}{2}<r$, so $v$ is in $S$ and by the subspace property of $S$, $v_k$ is in $S$ too, a contradiction to $m<n$.  \nI have primarily 2 questions:\n(1) Is there a simpler method to proof the conjecture for the finite dimensional case?\n(2) Is the conjecture true for the infinite dimensional case?\nSorry, if the question admits a very trivial answer. The motivation behind my question , is the fact that an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is not open in $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, etc.        \n",
