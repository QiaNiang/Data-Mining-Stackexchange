         "Spin is a technical term specifically referring to intrinsic angular momentum of particles. It means a very specific thing in quantum/particle physics. (Physicists often borrow loosely related everyday words and give them a very precise physical/mathematical definition.)\nSince truly fundamental particles (e.g. electrons) are point entities, i.e. have no true size in space, it does not make sense to consider them 'spinning' in the common sense, yet they still possess their own angular momenta. Note however, that like many quantum states (fundamental variables of systems in quantum mechanics,) spin is quantised; i.e. it can only take one of a set of discrete values. Specifically, the allowed values of the spin quantum number $s$ are non-negative multiples of 1/2. The actual spin momentum (denoted $S$) is a multiple of Planck's constant, and is given by $S = \\hbar \\sqrt{s (s + 1)}$.\nWhen it comes to composite particles (e.g. nuclei, atoms), spin is actually fairly easy to deal with. Like normal (orbital) angular momentum, it adds up linearly. Hence a proton, made of three constituent quarks, has overall spin 1/2.\nIf you're curious as to how this (initially rather strange) concept of spin was discovered, I suggest reading about the Stern-Gerlach experiment of the 1920s. It was later put into the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics by Schrodinger and Pauli.\n",

         "In general usage, \"sound\" refers to our perception of the vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in some medium, typically air or water, though sound waves can travel through any medium.  \nVibrations are produced whenever objects cause the particles in the medium to oscillate, e.g. clapping your hands together, beating a drum, or yelling.  \nSound can be measured the way it is heard - just as air molecules begin to vibrate in the presence of a vibrating object - the air molecules can cause other things to vibrate (such as our eardrums, or a part of a microphone) and we can quantify the level of sound by measuring the motion of the detector in any number of ways.\nAt a deeper level, sound waves are the \"Goldstone modes\" corresponding to broken translational symmetry of the surrounding medium.  \nLet me try to bring this a little more down to earth.  Think about a parcel of air, large enough to contain a lot of air molecules, but not so large that there are sizable air currents swirling within.  We can think of this in an ideal situation as being a fluid of uniform density.  This fluid has translational symmetry - if I translate it a little in any direction, it looks more or less the same \"in the bulk\".  Translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry, so I can squeeze the air in a spatially-varying way.  It turns out that if I do this in a wavelike pattern with a long wavelength, this is an excitation that costs very little energy, and hence will be important to the physics.  These waves are precisely sound waves.  This probably doesn't make much sense as I've written it, so I may try to edit this a bit later on if anyone is actually interested in this point of view.\n",

      "  Imagine going to the rest frame of a massive particle.  In this frame, there is rotational symmetry, which means that the Lie algebra of rotations acts on the wave function.  So the wave function is a vector in a representation of Lie(SO(3)) = Lie(SU(2)).  \"Spin\" is the label of precisely which representation this is.  Note that while SO(3) and SU(2) share a Lie algebra, they are different as groups, and it is a fact of life (\"the connection between spin and statistics\") that some particles -- fermions, with half-integral spin -- transform under representations of SU(2) while others -- bosons, with integral spin -- transform under SO(3).\n",
      "\n",
      "  Spin is a technical term specifically referring to intrinsic angular momentum of particles. It means a very specific thing in quantum/particle physics. (Physicists often borrow loosely related everyday words and give them a very precise physical/mathematical definition.)\n",
      "Since truly fundamental particles (e.g. electrons) are point entities, i.e. have no true size in space, it does not make sense to consider them 'spinning' in the common sense, yet they still possess their own angular momenta. Note however, that like many quantum states (fundamental variables of systems in quantum mechanics,) spin is quantised; i.e. it can only take one of a set of discrete values. Specifically, the allowed values of the spin quantum number  are non-negative multiples of 1/2. The actual spin momentum (denoted ) is a multiple of Planck's constant, and is given by .\n",
      "When it comes to composite particles (e.g. nuclei, atoms), spin is actually fairly easy to deal with. Like normal (orbital) angular momentum, it adds up linearly. Hence a proton, made of three constituent quarks, has overall spin 1/2.\n",
      "If you're curious as to how this (initially rather strange) concept of spin was discovered, I suggest reading about the Stern-Gerlach experiment of the 1920s. It was later put into the theoretical framework of quantum mechanics by Schrodinger and Pauli.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Spin is angular momentum of particles. The lowest possible spin is 1/2 h-bar.  It's impossible for any particle with angular momentum to have a lower angular momentum than this, and whatever angular momentum a particle does have must be an integer multiple of this. Consider it the angular momentum building block. It's value is 340 dB below a kilogram meter squared radian per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I'm trying to give a less technical answer. It's not rigorous but should give you the idea how spin and the regular rotation related.\n",
      "Maxwell's equations say in order to have magnetic field, you need a ring current.\n",
      "This can be achieved by giving angular momentum to charged particles. This can be orbital or simply because the particle is spinning. This was the original thought hence the name 'spin'.\n",
      "So in the classical picture, if you spin a tiny charged ball you'll have a spinning magnet. The axis of spinning and the north pole of the magnet pointing to the same direction.\n",
      "If you put this spinning magnet into a magnetic field. The field will apply torque on it to turn it into the direction of the field (this is how compasses work).\n",
      "But since the our magnet is spinning this torque cause the axis of spinning precess around the magnetic field.\n",
      "This means the component of the rotation axis that is parallel to the magnetic field (typically referred as the Z component) won't change while the other two components (X,Y) will circle around this axis. \n",
      "On the other hand if the magnetic field inhomogeneous there will be a net force on the particle that will move it (that's why magnets can snap and repel each other). This force is proportional to the Z component. So the axis perpendicular to the magnetic field there will be no force, if it's parallel there will be maximum force (basically a dot product). This allows us measuring the Z component of the rotation axis.\n",
      "That's the point of the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment. We would normally expect that particles will spin in a whole variety of random axes. So we would expect to measure random values for the Z component.\n",
      "But in reality they have measured only two possible values corresponding to the Z angular momentum component:  and  (for electrons). And not any other random values. Here the classical picture breaks down, angular momentum is also quantized. You can see spin is not the classical rotation vector. It's something you can dot multiply a vector to and you can only get two possible values. The positive component typically referred as the 'up' spin component while the negative is the 'down' spin.\n",
      "Precession renders all axes other than the one being measured uncertain. This is how uncertainty principle plays role here: if you measure the Z component first, then measure the X component, then the Z again, you get random up/down results again, because the measurement of the X components precessed the Y and Z component. Also, you cannot cheat here: you may want to use weaker magnetic field to reduce the precession, the displacement will be too weak to distinguish between the up and down spins. If you try to use timing; you cannot cheat again because if you measure the time accurately, then the energy so the precession rate becomes uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "  All particles have spin. Though it may be zero.\n",
      "At the most basic level, spin tells you how a particle transforms under rotations. For a spin  particle there are  states, which transform into one another when it's rotated (or when the system is rotated around it). So a spin 0 particle like the Higgs is just one state, a spin  particle like an electron has two ('up' and 'down'), a spin one particle like the  has 3, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  More than ten years later, time is ripe for a more up-to-date answer.\n",
      "Let's consider the case of the electron. Other particles have non-zero spin, and the following considerations will be valid for them, too, with minor changes.\n",
      "From a formal point of view, the spin  of the electron tells us that we need more than one wave function to describe its properties. Indeed, in a classical regime (Pauli's equation), we need a two-component wavefunction, while in a relativistic regime (Dirac's equation), we need four components. This fact can be nicely re-expressed in terms of the dimensionality of the irreducible representation of the Poincar√© group, but it doesn't help to build intuition about the spin.\n",
      "I find it more helpful to start from the relation between the angular momentum of an electron in an atom and the magnetic moment. We know from the solution of Schr√∂dnger's equation for the Hydrogen atom that the magnetic dipole moment of the eigenstates is proportional to the eigenvalue  of the  component of angular momentum. We can explain the presence of a magnetic dipole with a non-zero probability density current (and then a corresponding electric density current) associated with the non-zero- wavefunctions. Therefore, the normal angular momentum is associated with wavefunctions carrying a non-zero probability density current.\n",
      "The argument can be extended to the intrinsic spin relating it to a space-independent part of the angular momentum originating from the probability current in the two-component Pauli wavefunction. Details can be found in a paper by Mita ( American Journal of Physics 68, 259 (2000); DOI: 10.1119/1.19421 ) and also in some of its references, in particular, the paper by Ohanian.\n",

In the 1960s, a primitive vesion of this idea was called the S-matrix principle.\n",
